Project Summary

We were contacted by Budwiesier to take a look at a dataset they have obtained and to turn the data into information. Essentially the data contained over 2400 individual beers and over 500 breweries, nonetheless, lots of data to analyze.

Budwiesier asked the following questions of us:
1) How many breweries are in each state?
2) To merge the beer dataset and the brewery dataset
3) To address the missing values in each column
4) Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit count in each state
5) Determine which state has the single highest ABV beer, and which state has the highest IBU beer.
6) Discuss the summary statistics and distribution of ABV variables
7) Determine if there is a relationship between IBU and its alcoholic content by using a visualization 
8) Use KNN to classify beers as IPAs or Ales, and we used a Naive Bayes classifer to determine this relationship as well
9) We also examined a relationship between IBU and style and determined for specific styles, there is quite an association.







You can assume that your audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (your client) and that they only have had one class in statistics and have indicated that you cannot take more than 7 minutes of their time. 20% of your grade will be based on the presentation.
